### Hi there, I'm Asia! I transitioned into tech from a non-technical background January 2021. 👋



- 🏆 Globant Rising Star In Tech Award U.K. - Winner 🎉

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my technical, problem solving, leadership and communication skills through:
<br>

- 💁🏽‍♀️ Mentoring software engineering students with [Coding Black Females](https://codingblackfemales.com/) and [Black Girls In Tech](https://www.blackgirlsintech.org/)
- 📚 Completing multiple bootcamps such as Software Engineering Nanodegree with [Code First Girls](https://codefirstgirls.org.uk/courses/nanodegree/) and a Blockchain Development Bootcamp with [ConsenSys](https://consensys.net/) 

<br>

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data structures & Algorithms and AWS Cloud Practioner.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Machine Learning, Software Engineering and Blockchain Development projects.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with AWS and mentorship.
- 💬 Ask me about OOP, Blockchain, Leadership and Software Engineering. 
- 📫 How to reach me: asiasharif79@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: Less than 1% of the world have my personality (Advocate personality) and I enjoy playing chess.
